## How to launch:

1. `git clone`
2. `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git` to update the origin remote with your own repository / `git remote rm origin` to remove the origin remote
3. `npm i`
4. `npm start` / `npm run dev`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
6. `npm run build` to create `dist` for production

P.S. Don't forget to remove extra info like keywords, repository, etc. from `package.json`.

## What is this?

_Webpack Modules_ is an easy and robust webpack config to handle anything you can imagine, using the best practices.

Work in progress.

## Out of the box

## Dependencies

You **should** `npx npm-check-updates -u && npm i` as _Webpack Modules_ will always be ok working with the latest versions of the dependencies, so it is **strongly recommended**.
